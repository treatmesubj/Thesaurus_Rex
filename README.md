# Thesaurus Rex
It's a command-line thesaurus tool that uses thesaurus.com to define a word and present its homonyms and their synonyms via HTTP requests, regular expressions, and JSON.

### Setup
cd/ into dir of the script or just put it on your system's PATH so you can use it from anywhere

### Usage

`thesr.py [word]`

if `thesr.py [word]` is too tedious, you can call thesr.exe to call thesr.py for you: `thesr [word]`

if you call `thesr` without a word argument, it'll use a random word from Webster's recent words of the day
